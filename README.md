**Task 1: System Monitoring Setup****

**nmon (Nigelâ€™s Monitor)** is a performance monitoring tool for Linux and AIX systems. It provides real-time CPU, memory, disk, network, and other system performance metrics in a simple terminal interface.

  **Installation of nmon**
  
    #sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

    #nmon

The above command will give several option to get system resource utilization. All the options are listed below

c - CPU information

V - Virtual memory

n - Network I/O

t - Top-processes

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d2725be-6ea4-40f2-9883-39f78d00f4ca)

    #nmon -f -s 10 -c 30
      
It will create a .nmon file. The file name will be having hostname of the machine, followed by today's date and current time. For eg hostname_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.nmon
 
 -f --> Creating the nmon extention file
 
 -s --> Sample data every 10 seconds
 
 -c --> Collects the 30 samples

 To analyze .nmon files we are using nmonchart.

 **nmonchart Installation**

    #wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aguther/nmonchart/master/nmonchart

    #chmod +x nmonchar

    #sudo apt-get install mksh

    #./nmonchart your_nmon_file.nmon output_report.html

After getting the html file. Open that in web browser. We will get the graphical represention of system vitals utilization.

    #df -h
This command is used to get the disk utilization information in human readable format.

**<font size="20">Task 2: User Management and Access Control</font>**
 
 **Configuaring the complex password to the user**

Edit the file /etc/pam.d/system-auth. We need to the change line number 20 as like given below

password    requisite                                    pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=12 dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 enforce_for_root

After the we need to restart the sshd
    #systemctl restart sshd

We have tried to change password with weak password. We got the error. After we have given strong password it accepted. Please find the screenshot below.
